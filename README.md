# Woof Grid App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is a coding assignment assigned by RoosterTeeth.

This app renders a list of lazy loaded images from [dog.ceo](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/).

TODO:
- Testing. I really wanted to do this but didn't schedule enough time
- Didn't get to the bonus portion (sub-breeds).
- hooking up typescript would be fun!
- Breaking up DogList into smaller components would be ideal.
- A better transition for when a user is searching through the breeds. Something similar to "vue transition group" with arrays
- Have a placeholder image for the lazy loaded images
- Loading the names of the dogs once the image is fully loaded
- Getting a huge list of image urls through a loop is bad practice. I wish the API had a better way of grabbing all the image urls in bulk. 
**After I turned the project in thoughts**
- using local storage to store API data
- using lazy loaded components for images. When images scroll into view, call API for url, then load image.

Questions to ask:
- onChange - comment within DogList.js
- fetchImg - comment within DogList.js

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
